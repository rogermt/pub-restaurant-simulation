# Executive Summary - Restaurant Simulation Project

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

The Restaurant Simulation project is a **SimPy-based discrete event simulation**
for modeling fast-food restaurant operations. The project has successfully
completed **Phase 3** with a comprehensive simulation runner, but requires
immediate integration and quality improvements before advancing to enhanced
features.

______________________________________________________________________

## 📊 **Current Status**

### ✅ **Completed (Phase 3)**

- **Simulation Engine**: Complete SimulationRunner with customer generation
- **CLI Interface**: Professional command-line interface with argparse
- **Customer Analytics**: InHouse vs FoodApp customer breakdown (70/30 split)
- **Test Coverage**: 26 comprehensive tests (15 existing + 11 new)
- **Multiple Runs**: Aggregate results across multiple simulation runs

### ⚠️ **Critical Gaps & Blockers**

- **🚨 BLOCKER**: Phase 3 branch has linting failures preventing merge
  - 3 files need black reformatting: `src/restaurant.py`, `src/simulation.py`,
    `tests/test_simulation.py`
- **Phase 3 NOT MERGED**: All new functionality exists only on
  `phase3-simulation-runner` branch
- **Main Branch**: Still has basic test-only main.py, missing simulation
  capabilities
