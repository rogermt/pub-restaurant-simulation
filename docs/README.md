# Design README for Flowchart TD

## Overview

This flowchart TD illustrates the process flow of a fast-food restaurant in a UK
public house food service, which caters to both in-house and online customers.
The system involves a customer placing an order, which is then sent to the
kitchen for preparation. Once the food is ready, it is served to the customer or
delivered through a food delivery app. The flowchart also includes queues for
managing the order, cook, serve, and app order requests.

## Flowchart Structure

The flowchart consists of two subgraphs - Flow and Queue.

### Flow

The Flow subgraph displays the process flow and the interactions between the
entities involved, as follows:

1. In-House Customer and Food App Customer place an order.
1. Order Taker/Server takes the order and sends it to the kitchen.
1. Kitchen prepares the food and notifies the Server and the Food Delivery App
   driver.
1. Server serves the food to the customer.
1. Food Delivery App driver delivers the food to the customer.

### Queue

The Queue subgraph displays the queues for each request type and the order in
which they are processed, as follows:

1. Order Queue manages the order requests on a first-in-first-out basis.
1. Cook Queue manages the cook requests based on priority.
1. Serve Queue manages the serve requests on a first-in-first-out basis.
1. App Order Queue manages the app order requests on a first-in-first-out basis.

Note that physical delivery to the customer is not simulated in this project.

## Usage

To use this flowchart TD, simply follow the arrows in the Flow subgraph to
understand the order processing system. The Queue subgraph provides a visual
representation of the queues for each request type.

## Conclusion

This flowchart TD provides a clear and concise overview of the order processing
system of a food service establishment. It demonstrates the interactions between
the entities involved and the queues for managing the order, cook, serve, and
app order requests.
